- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @amntheap
- ðŸ‘€ So I entered this field because I always wondered about learning. Learning of myself as a human being, I was never surprised about learning of machines.
  Machines are invented to learn I suppose. So, Iâ€™m into machine learning because I think itâ€™s a desperate try of humans to understand how they learn things.
  Or it is? Do we already know how humans learn? I donâ€™t know. it is probably a psychological and medical science obje and I was never in to it.
  I was always in love with sports and machines. Not medical science.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning machine learning and data science by Coursera, teaching by Michigan University.
- ðŸ“« I have a telegram account with the same ID .
